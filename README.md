# ansible-redhat_openshift_utils
Ansible content supplemental to the openshift-ansible project for doing things that don't ship with that project, such as prerequisites for updates, upgrades, restarts, etc.

## Playbooks
Playbooks provided by this project.

### ocp-rolling-os-update-and-upgrade.yml
Performs a rolling (one host at a time) operating system (OS) update and/or upgrade to the OCP cluster. This is done as per the instructions at [Operating System Updates and Upgrades](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/upgrading/os_upgrades.html).

#### Assumptions
* etcd is deployed to masters
  * pull request welcome to make this work with etcd either on masters or on seperate nodes

#### Required groups
* masters
* infra-nodes
* app-nodes

#### Default Vars (defaults/main.yml)
* ocp_deployment_version: <ocp version>
* ocp_docker_storage: <device to use for docker storage>
* expected_docker_version: <1.13.1 if using OCP 3.11>
* ocp_repositories: <which repos to enable>
* ocp_deployment_packages: <required packages for OCP>

### ocp-install-preparation.yml
Performs some prerequisite steps before [Installing OpenShift](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install/host_preparation.html)

### ocp-upgrade-preparation.yml
Executes the steps that should be performed before [Performing Automated In-place Cluster Upgrades](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.html). Specifically before running the appropriate upgrade playbook in the [openshift-ansible](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/) project.

This is essentially an ansible version of [Preparing for an Automated Upgrade] (https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.html#preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade).

### ocp-upgrade-cleanup.yml
Executes the steps that should be performed after [Performing Automated In-place Cluster Upgrades](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.html). Specifically after running the appropriate upgrade playbook in the [openshift-ansible](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/) project.

### ocp-ldap-groups-sync.yml
